# Warehouse Automation Algorithm

## Input
- Goods arrive on the input conveyor.
- Customer orders are received via the WMS with barcode/NFC data.
- Inventory database tracks goodsâ€™ location and status.

## Process
1. **Goods Reception**:
   - Goods enter via the input conveyor.
   - Vision system or RFID scanner identifies items and updates the inventory database.

2. **Storage by Robots**:
   - Cartesian robot receives slot coordinates from the WMS.
   - Robot picks goods from the conveyor using a suitable gripper.
   - Goods are placed on slanted shelves for gravity-assisted movement.
   - Update inventory with slot location.

3. **Order Processing**:
   - WMS receives an order and identifies required items via barcode/NFC.
   - Picking robot on the opposite side scans shelves and retrieves items.
   - Retrieved items are placed on the output conveyor.

4. **Order Assembly**:
   - Output conveyor transports items to a sorting station.
   - Additional robots (if needed) group items to complete the order.
   - Order is sealed and labeled for dispatch.

5. **Dispatch**:
   - Completed orders move to the dispatch area via the output conveyor.

## Output
- Fully assembled customer orders ready for shipping.
- Real-time inventory updates.

## Error Handling
- If item identification fails, redirect to a re-scan zone.
- If a shelf slot is full, WMS reassigns to another slot.
- If an order item is unavailable, notify WMS to adjust the order.
